This is my soln for to a Hootsuite puzzle I found in ../originalHootsuitePuzzle 
Note that the file ENCRYPTED is the original hootsuite puzzle's README with the header trimmed out

-- your TODO
convert this README to README.md (mark down)
* see: https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax
Read up on requirements.txt (Google "python requirements.txt or pipenv")
Read up on regexp (Google Regexp and the python "re" module)
We both make a "mistake" on uploading a soln publicly ( but its a good mistake ... can u guess what it is.  Hint https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/ )
Given that we made this mistake, I do have a suggestion for apologizing to Hootsuite


A bit of code review and git comments:
* your repository name is OwlDevPuzzlePythonScriptSolution and you have a single directory called DevOwlPuzzlePythonScriptSolution
underneath it.  Renamve DevOwlPuzzlePythonScriptSolution to mySoln
* I would prefer your repository to be owl-dev-puzzle rather than OwlDevPuzzlePythonScriptSolution
* See: https://github.com/python for the naming convention example
* See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11947587/is-there-a-naming-convention-for-git-repositories
* my preference is that subDir of repos are camelCase, but the repo is "dashed"
* remove the DECODED file
* wrt https://github.com/WongMatthew/OwlDevPuzzlePythonScriptSolution/blob/master/DevOwlPuzzlePythonScriptSolution/main.py
* remove line2 if you are not using the import
* line5 ... "file" is not a good variable name.  "open" returns a fileObject and "read" returns the contents of the file
* line6, you are not using "output".  remove this line
* line 12 & 13 ... your are using the str() method ... no need for that ... I actually like using a regexp (less lines of code)
* See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/538346/iterating-each-character-in-a-string-using-python
* line16, no need for that debugging line after you get the soln to work ... remove
* line19 ... does nothing, remove


Random Thoughts (not necessarily related to this project)
You mentioned that your HS computer science teacher is helping you, correct?
First off, thank him for me.
Secondly, are there any more computer science courses you can take in your highschool for next year?
If your relationship is good -> excellent with your teacher, ask him if you could be his TA (teaching assistant) next year  
See:
https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/k-12/support/graduation/getting-credit-to-graduate/external-credentials
You can help him mark assignments and/or spend time helping other students.
Another possibility is to ask your principal or vice-principal what kind of projects they need for the school
Does your school website need any editing?  Does your school have any internal grading system software that needs
updating?  Do any teachers need help "pushing" some of their course material online?
Also if he is up for it, you can use that "elective" computer science course to work on your own project.
BTW, do you like animation?  Do you know how to animate pictures?  Interested in learning?
FYI, we should work on a "youWin" cinematic (animation) for figuring out our puzzle
